In 3 days I went from **zero** to a fully deployed, professional blog at [datainsidedata.com](https://datainsidedata.com).

This wasn’t just a “hello world” experiment. I wanted a lean, pro-grade stack for my LLC using:

✔ Jekyll (static site generator)  
✔ GitHub Pages (free hosting)  
✔ AWS Route 53 (custom domain + DNS)

This post + video will show you exactly how I did it, what I learned, and how you can replicate (or improve) the setup for your business, nonprofit, or personal brand.

| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Jekyll             | Static site generator |
| GitHub Pages       | Free hosting for site |
| AWS Route 53       | DNS + custom domain   |
| VS Code            | Local development     |
| datainsidedata.com | My custom domain      |

## 💡 Why Jekyll Instead of Just HTML/CSS/JS?

When I started this, I asked myself: *“Why not just code a static site by hand?”*

Here’s why I chose Jekyll:

### 🚀 1. Built for Blogs

Jekyll was literally designed for blogs. It supports:

- **Markdown posts**
- Categories & tags out of the box
- Auto-generated archive & pagination
- Clean permalinks like `/2025/07/12/why-jekyll.html`

With pure HTML/CSS/JS, I’d have to hand-code all of that.

### 💎 2. Minimalist and Professional

Jekyll doesn’t need a heavy backend (no PHP, no databases).  
It’s **just static files**—fast, secure, and deploys beautifully on GitHub Pages.

### 🧰 3. Gems and Themes = Less Reinventing the Wheel

- The **Minimal Mistakes** theme gave me a professional design instantly.
- Gems like `jekyll-feed` and `jekyll-seo-tag` handle RSS feeds & SEO for me.

Pure HTML/CSS/JS? I’d be reinventing:  
✔ Sitemap.xml  
✔ RSS feed  
✔ SEO metadata  
✔ Responsive layouts

### 💨 4. One Command → Whole Site Built

Jekyll lets me run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

…and it renders all posts, layouts, and assets into the `_site` folder, ready for deployment.

In a pure static setup, I’d manually copy/paste and keep track of every link. 😬

## 📦 Initial Setup: Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes Theme

### 1️⃣ Install Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll

```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
```

### 2️⃣ Create a new Jekyll site

```bash
jekyll new datainsidedata-website
cd datainsidedata-website
bundle install
```

### 3️⃣ Add the Minimal Mistakes theme for a clean, professional look

### 4️⃣ Configure `_config.yml`

- Set site title, description, author info
- Enable pagination & pretty permalinks
- Set up categories & tags

📂 **Project Structure (before build):**

```bash
_data/
_includes/
_layouts/
_pages/
_posts/
_site/  (auto-generated by Jekyll build)
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain with GitHub Pages + AWS Route 53

### 🗂 Private + Public Repo Workflow

Since GitHub Pages doesn’t serve from private repos unless you pay for Pro:

1. Private repo: `did-site-private` (holds full Jekyll source)
2. Public repo: `did-site-public` (hosts built site for Pages)

👨🏾‍💻 Local workflow:

```bash
# Build site
bundle exec jekyll build

# Push to public repo
cd _site
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/dataeden/did-site-public.git
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy"
git push -u origin main
```

### 🏷️ AWS Route 53 DNS Setup

✅ Add A records:

```bash
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

✅ Add a CNAME file in the public repo:

```bash
datainsidedata.com
```

✅ Verify domain with GitHub:  
Add a TXT record in Route 53 like:

```bash
_github-pages-challenge.datainsidedata.com  TXT  "abc123xyz456"
```

✅ Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages after TLS cert provision.

## ⚡ Sneak Peek: Automating with GitHub Actions (No More _site Pushes!)

Here’s the workflow I’m planning:

📂 **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Jekyll Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Watch for changes in private repo

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout private repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Ruby + Jekyll
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: '3.1'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: bundle install

    - name: Build site
      run: bundle exec jekyll build

    - name: Deploy to public repo
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./_site
        publish_branch: main
        destination_repo: dataeden/did-site-public
```

🎯 With this in place:

- Push to `did-site-private`
- GitHub Actions auto-builds & deploys to `did-site-public`
- No more manual `_site` pushes 🚀

## 🚨 Lessons Learned

💥 _pages folder pain: Jekyll didn’t respect links until I restructured pages.  
🔥 Custom nav bar: Built my own in ```bash _includes/header.html + _includes/nav.html.```  
🕒 DNS propagation: Patience and coffee are dev tools too.  

## 🎯 The Result

✅ Live at datainsidedata.com  
✅ Clean navigation, custom logo, HTTPS-secured  
✅ Learned Jekyll + DNS at a pro level

## 📝 What’s Next?

✔ Publish more posts (like this one!)  
✔ Add Google Analytics  
✔ Fully automate deploys with GitHub Actions  
✔ Share more dev journey content
